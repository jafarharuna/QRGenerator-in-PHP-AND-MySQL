# php-dig
## Introduction

[PHP DNS functions](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.network.php) don't have a timeout while the default timeout for dig is 5 seconds (with several (3) tries) 

It should drastically decrease time to get dns records, and lower failure errors like `dns_get_record(): A temporary server error occurred.`

## Installation
Install the latest version with

```console
$ composer require fhferreira/php-dig
```

## Usage

```php
$client = new Hostinger\DigClient();
$result = $client->getRecord('hostinger.com', DNS_MX);
```

This is equal to 
```php
dns_get_record('hostinger.com', DNS_MX);
```

Package checks if it can run `exec` in server environment, otherwise it will fallback to dns_get_record().

### DigClient implements LoggerAwareInterface
You can set [logger](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/) to debug / log package activity
```php
$client = new Hostinger\DigClient();
$logger = new \Monolog\Logger\Logger('App');
$logger->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('path/to/your.log'));
$client->setLogger($logger);
```
